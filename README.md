# SorryGuys
A WoW-Addon to refuse friends chats

When invited into a friends chat, there is no possibility to refuse the invitation.
This addon can't help with that, but it sends a configured message into this channel and automatically leaves, when you configured not to be hijacked.
Take a look at the options under Interface->Addons->SorryGuys

Not my first addon, but I took MappCoords (by ReCover) as a skeleton. This had to be a fast job ;-) Thanks!

This addon is not functional for now. It doesn't work with retail or classic. This repository is for archiving and maybe taking inspiration.
